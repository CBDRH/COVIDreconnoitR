#' Patch the china case records
#'
#' In Mid February, China changed their case definition, from
#'   RT-PCR-swab-positive to test-positive or clinical signs of viral pneumonia.
#'   This led to a large spike not representative of cases.
#'   some further thoughts:
#'    \url{https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/how-to-interpret-feb-12-case-surge/}
#'   This changes the cases on the dates shown below to the verified lab-confirmed only counts
#'   available at
#'   https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:2019â€“20_coronavirus_pandemic_data/China_medical_cases_by_province&oldid=946973173
#'   Note that the EuroCDC data has dates a day later than the wikipedia data for China
#'   due to time zone differences. This adjustment is only valid for EuroCDC data, for the JHU
#'   data the dates for the adjustments need to be shifted back on day.

#'     - 13/2/2020 to 1820 cases (from 15141),
#'     - 14/2/2020 to 1995 cases (from 3237),
#'     - 15/2/2020 to 1503 cases (from 2538),
#'     - 16/2/2020 to 1121 cases (from 2007),

#' @param data data pulled by `try_ecdc` and `pluck_latest`.
#' @note internal
