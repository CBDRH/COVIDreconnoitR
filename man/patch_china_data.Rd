\description{
In Mid February, China changed their case definition, from
RT-PCR-swab-positive to test-positive or clinical signs of viral pneumonia.
This led to a large spike not representative of cases.

This changes the cases on the dates shown below to the verified lab-confirmed only counts
available at
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:2019â€“20_coronavirus_pandemic_data/China_medical_cases_by_province&oldid=946973173
Note that the EuroCDC data has dates a day later than the wikipedia data for China
due to time zone differences. This adjustment is only valid for EuroCDC data, for the JHU
data the dates for the adjustments need to be shifted back on day.
- 13/2/2020 to 1820 cases (from 15141),
- 14/2/2020 to 1995 cases (from 3237),
- 15/2/2020 to 1503 cases (from 2538),
- 16/2/2020 to 1121 cases (from 2007),
