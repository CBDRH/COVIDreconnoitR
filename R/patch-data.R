#' Patch the case records for China and Italy
#'
#' In Mid February 2020, China changed their case definition, from
#'   RT-PCR-swab-positive to test-positive or clinical signs of viral pneumonia.
#'   This led to a large spike not representative of cases.
#'   some further thoughts:
#'    \url{https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/how-to-interpret-feb-12-case-surge/}
#'   This changes the cases on the dates shown below to the verified lab-confirmed only counts
#'   available at
#'   https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:2019â€“20_coronavirus_pandemic_data/China_medical_cases_by_province&oldid=946973173
#'   Note that the EuroCDC data has dates a day later than the wikipedia data for China
#'   due to time zone differences. This adjustment is only valid for EuroCDC data, for the JHU
#'   data the dates for the adjustments need to be shifted back on day.

#'     - 13/2/2020 to 1820 cases (from 15141),
#'     - 14/2/2020 to 1995 cases (from 3237),
#'     - 15/2/2020 to 1503 cases (from 2538),
#'     - 16/2/2020 to 1121 cases (from 2007),
#'
#' In addition, there are some anomalies with Italy, resulting in these changes
#'
#'     - 15/3: to 3497 cases (from ...)
#'     - 16/3: to 3590 cases (from ...)
#'     - 17/3: to 3233 cases (from ...)
#'
#' These changes for Italy came from the WHO situation reports: \url{https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports}.
